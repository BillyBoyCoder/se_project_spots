# Spots - Responsive Web Application

A responsive web application project focused on displaying content correctly across popular screen sizes. This project emphasizes mobile-first design principles and cross-device compatibility.

##  Project Overview

Spots is a software engineering project designed to demonstrate responsive web development skills. The application ensures all elements are displayed correctly on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!

## Design Resources

This project is based on Figma designs. When working on similar projects:

1. **Export images directly from Figma** for accurate implementation
2. **Optimize images** using tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before adding to project
3. **Follow design specifications** for spacing, typography, and colors
4. **Test on multiple devices** to ensure responsive behavior

##  Responsive Breakpoints

```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Tablet styles */
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Desktop styles */
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
  /* Large desktop styles */
}
```

##  Testing

- **Cross-browser testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Device testing**: Various mobile devices and screen sizes
- **Performance testing**: Page load speed and optimization
- **Accessibility testing**: Screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Performance Optimization

- **Image Compression**: All images optimized for web delivery
- **CSS Minification**: Compressed stylesheets for faster loading
- **Responsive Images**: Multiple image sizes for different screen densities
- **Efficient CSS**: Optimized selectors and minimal redundancy

##  Development Guidelines

- Follow semantic HTML practices
